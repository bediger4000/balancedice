## Analysis

Another puzzle that just assumes too much.
In this case it assumes (I think) that the pips on the dice have some weight,
so you balance based on pip-count.

Physically, this is silly.
People go out of their way to make dice that aren't biased in the slightest,
even though pip counts aren't the same on any 2 faces.
Using physical intuition, the answer is any 6 on one side, the other 6 on the other side.

2 3 3 3 4 4
4 4 4 5 6 6
